i take no responsibility for what hagrid does. 

Java hagrid may have some problem but requires no setup.

.Bat hagrid is much more reliable, but only works on windows, and requires you open the file and replace  "putoyurusernamehere"  with your windows username

.Bat hagridB is an alternate to .Bat hagrid if it doesn't work.
